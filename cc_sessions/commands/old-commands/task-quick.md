Quick task capture: $ARGUMENTS

Create a minimal task file at sessions/tasks/$ARGUMENTS.md with:
- Task name from $ARGUMENTS
- Branch determined from prefix
- Today's date
- Pending status
- "TODO: Fill in details" as the problem/goal
- Placeholder success criteria: "[ ] Define specific success criteria"
- Note in User Notes: "Quick capture - needs refinement"

Just create it - we'll refine details when we start work on it.
