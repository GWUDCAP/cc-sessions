`Expand this and then format it as a concise problem statement section - we might re-position it`

- There is no prescribed way to remember things
- You discover problems faster than you solve them and have to remember what you want to fix/do
- The list of things you need to manually do to be productive (add files to context, write specs, etc.) only grows
  - Remember to compact/clear
  - Remember to add files to context
  - Read every diff before approving
  - Manage allowed tools
  - Remember to run slash commands
  - Remember to write specs/task files and complete them
  - Remember to commit/merge/push etc.
- Claude doesn't discuss - ask a question and he will start coding without talking
- Auto-compaction doesn't capture the detail in a way that inspires confidence for continuing the task
- You often have to spend 20% of your context window gathering proper context (and still miss important stuff)
- LLMs are really bad at following a list of rules for an entire context window (CLAUDE.md poor control surface)

## Features

### Claude *earns* the right to code
- By default, Claude can't use write-like tools of *any* kind
- Claude has to prove he understands what you want
- Claude has to propose todos you agree with
- Once you agree, you can use a trigger phrase (customizable)

### Claude needs your consent
