## Success Criteria
- [ ] Agent completes without hanging
- [ ] Context manifest is generated

## Context Manifest

### How This Currently Works: Agent Invocation and Context Management

The cc-sessions framework implements a sophisticated agent delegation system built around Claude Code's Task tool. When a user or Claude invokes an agent, the system executes a multi-step workflow that preserves conversation context while creating isolated execution environments for specialized operations.

**Agent Invocation Flow:**
When the Task tool is called with a `subagent_type` parameter, the `task-transcript-link.py` pre-tool-use hook intercepts the call. This hook performs several critical operations: it reads the current conversation transcript from the provided `transcript_path`, filters out any pre-work entries (looking for Edit/MultiEdit/Write tool usage as start markers), and cleans the transcript into a standardized format containing only user and assistant messages with role and content fields.

The hook then determines the agent type from the Task tool's input parameters and creates a dedicated state directory at `.claude/state/{subagent_type}` (e.g., `.claude/state/context-gathering`). This directory is cleared of any previous files to ensure a clean slate for the agent operation. Most importantly, the hook sets a `in_subagent_context.flag` file that prevents DAIC enforcement reminders from interfering with the agent's work.

**Context Chunking and Token Management:**
The system uses tiktoken (cl100k_base encoding) to count tokens and automatically chunks the conversation transcript into files of approximately 18,000 tokens each. This chunking is critical because it allows agents to receive comprehensive context even for very long conversations that would exceed token limits. The chunks are saved as `current_transcript_001.json`, `current_transcript_002.json`, etc., in the agent's state directory.

**Agent Execution Environment:**
Each agent runs in a separate Claude Code context window, completely isolated from the main conversation thread. The agent receives the conversation history through the chunked transcript files and has access to all the same tools as the main thread (Read, Edit, Grep, etc.), except for certain restrictions enforced by the sessions-enforce.py hook. Specifically, agents are blocked from modifying `.claude/state` files to prevent them from interfering with the main session's state management.

**DAIC Mode Integration:**
The framework operates with a Discussion-Alignment-Implementation-Check (DAIC) mode system stored in `.claude/state/daic-mode.json`. The current test is running in "implementation" mode, which allows the use of editing tools. However, agents inherit these permissions and operate outside of DAIC restrictions due to the subagent flag system.

**State Management and Branch Enforcement:**
The system maintains current task state in `.claude/state/current_task.json` with a specific format requiring "task" (name only), "branch" (git branch), "services" (affected modules), and "updated" (date) fields. Currently, no active task is set (all fields null), which means branch enforcement is not active. Branch enforcement, when enabled, prevents code editing unless the current git branch matches the task's expected branch pattern.

### For New Feature Implementation: Context-Gathering Agent Testing

Since this is a test of the context-gathering agent specifically, it will integrate with the existing system at these critical points:

**Agent Definition and Capability:**
The context-gathering agent is defined in `.claude/agents/context-gathering.md` and has access to comprehensive toolsets including semantic analysis tools (Serena MCP), memory bank storage (Memory Bank MCP), web research (DuckDuckGo MCP), and standard file operations. The agent's primary responsibility is reading task files and augmenting them with detailed context manifests that explain how existing systems work and what needs to be modified.

**Tool Access Patterns:**
Unlike the main Claude thread which is subject to DAIC enforcement, the context-gathering agent operates with full tool access due to the subagent protection flag. This allows it to perform extensive file reading, code analysis, and research without requiring user permission for each operation. However, it can only edit the specific task file provided to it - editing other codebase files is explicitly forbidden.

**MCP Integration:**
The agent has access to several MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers configured in `sessions/sessions-config.json`: Serena MCP for semantic code analysis, Memory Bank MCP for persistent context storage, and DuckDuckGo MCP for web research. These tools enable the agent to perform comprehensive analysis that goes beyond simple text search.

**Output Format and Integration:**
The agent must produce a "Context Manifest" section in the task file, inserting it after the task description but before work logs. This manifest follows a specific narrative format that explains current system behavior, integration requirements, and technical reference details. The manifest becomes part of the permanent task documentation and guides implementation work.

**Testing Validation Points:**
For this test task, success depends on: the agent completing without hanging or errors, producing a well-structured context manifest with narrative explanations, and properly updating the task file without corrupting its format. The agent should demonstrate its ability to research the cc-sessions codebase, understand the agent invocation system, and provide comprehensive context about how testing should work within this framework.

### Technical Reference Details

#### Agent Invocation Interface

**Task Tool Parameters:**
```json
{
  "subagent_type": "context-gathering",
  "prompt": "Create context manifest for task file: /path/to/task.md",
  "files": ["/path/to/task.md"]
}
```

**Transcript Chunking Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "role": "user|assistant",
    "content": "message content or tool usage blocks"
  }
]
```

#### State File Structures

**DAIC Mode State:**
```json
{
  "mode": "discussion|implementation"
}
```

**Task State (Required Format):**
```json
{
  "task": "task-name-without-path-or-extension",
  "branch": "feature/branch-name",
  "services": ["module1", "module2"],
  "updated": "YYYY-MM-DD"
}
```

#### Configuration Requirements

**Sessions Config Location:** `/sessions/sessions-config.json`
**MCP Server Configuration:**
- Serena MCP: Semantic code analysis
- Memory Bank MCP: Persistent context storage  
- DuckDuckGo MCP: Web research capabilities

#### File Locations

- **Agent definitions:** `.claude/agents/*.md`
- **Hook implementations:** `.claude/hooks/*.py` (copied from `cc_sessions/hooks/`)
- **State management:** `.claude/state/`
- **Transcript chunks:** `.claude/state/{agent_type}/current_transcript_*.json`
- **Task files:** `tasks/` or `sessions/tasks/`
- **Protocols:** `sessions/protocols/*.md`

#### Testing Implementation Guidance

The test should validate:
1. **Hook Integration:** Verify task-transcript-link.py correctly chunks conversation
2. **Agent Isolation:** Confirm subagent flag prevents DAIC interference  
3. **File Access:** Ensure agent can read codebase but only edit task file
4. **Output Quality:** Check context manifest contains narrative explanations
5. **Error Handling:** Verify graceful failure if MCP tools unavailable
6. **State Preservation:** Confirm main session state remains unchanged
