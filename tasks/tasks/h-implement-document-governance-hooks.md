# Implement Document Governance and Context Retention Hooks

## Problem/Goal
Implement comprehensive document governance system using Memory Bank MCP integration to ensure context retention, document consistency validation, and automated document versioning. This system will enforce that all code changes are validated against project documentation (PRD, FSD, story epics) and automatically preserve context before and after implementation phases while maintaining document version history.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Create hooks that automatically preserve context to Memory Bank after analysis (pre-implementation)
- [ ] Create hooks that preserve context to Memory Bank after implementation and testing completion
- [ ] Implement document storage system for PRD, FSD, and story epics with automatic context integration
- [ ] Create hooks that enforce document consistency validation before allowing implementation
- [ ] Implement conflict detection system that identifies when changes would violate existing documentation
- [ ] Create user confirmation flow when document conflicts are detected
- [ ] Implement automated document versioning system (keeping old versions)
- [ ] Update Memory Bank with revised document context when changes are approved
- [ ] Create document governance configuration options in sessions-config.json
- [ ] Implement graceful fallback when Memory Bank MCP is unavailable
- [ ] Create comprehensive testing suite for document governance workflows
- [ ] Update documentation with document governance setup and usage instructions

## User Notes
<!-- Any specific notes or requirements from the developer -->
User requirements:
1. Hooks must enforce context retention to Memory Bank after analysis completion (pre-implementation)
2. Hooks must preserve context after implementation and testing phases
3. Need dedicated storage for project docs (PRD, FSD, story epics) with automatic context integration
4. Hooks must enforce document consistency validation before implementation
5. System must detect conflicts between proposed changes and existing documentation
6. When conflicts arise, Claude should ask user for confirmation/direction
7. If user confirms doc changes needed, create revised versions while keeping old ones
8. Memory Bank must be updated with new document context after revisions
9. System should be robust and handle edge cases gracefully
