# GitHub MCP Server Integration

## Problem/Goal
Integrate GitHub MCP server to provide comprehensive GitHub repository management, issue/PR automation, CI/CD monitoring, and code analysis capabilities within the cc-sessions framework. This will enable AI-assisted GitHub workflow management including repository browsing, automated issue triage, workflow monitoring, and security analysis.

## Success Criteria
- [x] GitHub MCP server configuration added to both Python and Node.js installers
- [x] Configuration schema extended in sessions-config.json with GitHub MCP settings
- [x] Enhanced agents (context-gathering, code-review, semantic-analysis) with GitHub MCP tools integration
- [x] Repository management capabilities: browse code, search files, analyze commits, understand project structure
- [x] Issue & PR automation: create, update, manage issues and pull requests
- [x] CI/CD & workflow intelligence: monitor GitHub Actions, analyze build failures, manage releases
- [x] Code analysis features: examine security findings, review Dependabot alerts, understand code patterns
- [x] Documentation updated in MCP_README.md with GitHub integration section
- [x] Graceful fallback when GitHub MCP server unavailable
- [x] Authentication handling for GitHub API access
- [x] Rate limiting and API quota management
- [x] Git workflow automation: commit, merge, and push functionality via GitHub API
- [x] Post-task completion hooks for automated merge workflow
