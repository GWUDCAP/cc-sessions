# GitHub MCP Server Integration

## Problem/Goal
Integrate GitHub MCP server to provide comprehensive GitHub repository management, issue/PR automation, CI/CD monitoring, and code analysis capabilities within the cc-sessions framework. This will enable AI-assisted GitHub workflow management including repository browsing, automated issue triage, workflow monitoring, and security analysis.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] GitHub MCP server configuration added to both Python and Node.js installers
- [ ] Configuration schema extended in sessions-config.json with GitHub MCP settings
- [ ] Enhanced agents (context-gathering, code-review) with GitHub MCP tools integration
- [ ] Repository management capabilities: browse code, search files, analyze commits, understand project structure
- [ ] Issue & PR automation: create, update, manage issues and pull requests  
- [ ] CI/CD & workflow intelligence: monitor GitHub Actions, analyze build failures, manage releases
- [ ] Code analysis features: examine security findings, review Dependabot alerts, understand code patterns
- [ ] Documentation updated in MCP_README.md with GitHub integration section
- [ ] Graceful fallback when GitHub MCP server unavailable
- [ ] Authentication handling for GitHub API access
- [ ] Rate limiting and API quota management
