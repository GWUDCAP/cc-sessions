# Integrate Memory Bank MCP for Persistent Context Analysis

## Problem/Goal
Integrate the Memory Bank MCP server (https://github.com/alioshr/memory-bank-mcp) into cc-sessions framework to provide persistent context analysis capabilities. This integration will enable cc-sessions to maintain long-term memory of project context, ensure code changes align with existing PRD (Product Requirements Documents) and FSD (Functional Specification Documents), and provide continuity across sessions through intelligent context preservation and retrieval.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Research Memory Bank MCP capabilities and installation requirements
- [ ] Update both Python and Node.js installers to detect and offer Memory Bank MCP installation
- [ ] Add Memory Bank MCP configuration options to sessions-config.json
- [ ] Integrate Memory Bank MCP tools into context-gathering agent for persistent context
- [ ] Create document alignment verification using Memory Bank for PRD/FSD compliance
- [ ] Implement session continuity features leveraging Memory Bank's persistent storage
- [ ] Test Memory Bank MCP integration with cc-sessions workflow
- [ ] Update documentation to include Memory Bank MCP setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Verify graceful fallback when Memory Bank MCP is unavailable
- [ ] Add Memory Bank MCP section to MCP_README.md documentation
- [ ] Create agents or enhance existing ones to leverage Memory Bank for document consistency
